## Notice

This repository is mostly atonamous; it guarantees no stability or support. Github Actions handles 99% of repository maintenance, including bi-hourly (CI jobs start at 47 minutes after the hour) CD builds.

Manual intervention will happen either when an issue gets opened on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/lainware/Conduit-Containers/issues), or when I notice an issue.

# conduit-containers

Matrix-related containers, because they took up too much build time in the other repo.
